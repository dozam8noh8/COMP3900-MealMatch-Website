Week 1 (2020-05-31 to 2020-06-07)
=================================

  I started my session on Thursday 11:00-13:00 however the groups filled
  up much more quickly than I anticipated. As it turns out, quite a
  significant amount of people (at least for my session) were already in
  a group of some sort. Luckily there were more sessions for the same
  day so I managed to get into one during the Thursday 16:00-18:00
  session.

  We decided to choose *MealMatch* by unanimous decision as it was the
  most common pick held by the group. We also managed to get a Google
  document setup for our proposal as it was the most accessible tool for
  everybody. Some progress was made on the proposal in regards to the
  overall structure as well as implementation related details such as
  what tools or frameworks we were going to use. Overall, aside from
  extraneous details like setting up Jira, Github and group accounts,
  nothing much happened.


Week 2 (2020-06-08 to 2020-06-14)
=================================

  The first half of the week (i.e. before Thursday) saw no activity from
  me due to some faulty damage on my devices. Fortunately, by Thursday
  midday I was able to get my laptop running for the session. For the
  most part, we mostly continued the report as usual but with a narrower
  focus on the inner details such as the user stories that we were
  planning to do and the acceptance criteria for each and every one of
  them. We also discussed a lot things about the specification in
  regards to some of the more ambiguous parts such as deciding if user
  interactions should be allowed for non-logged in and non-registered
  users.  Regardless, we aimed to complete these tasks before assigning
  them on Jira so that the ones up there are the "completed" versions
  rather than the draft versions. (Of course, it goes without saying
  that these things can change as time goes so what I mean to say by
  "completed" only extends for a provisional time period before the
  actual tasks are being worked on).

  For me, I mainly concerned myself with learning more Angular since I
  had never used it before. I've used things like `React' along with
  `React-Redux' however those are more like third-party libraries that
  you can optionally include whenever you want to. In contrast, Angular
  is a full framework in and of itself so it seems to have a more
  opinionated way of doing things.

  At the same time, I also refreshed my knowledge of Flask as it's been
  a long time since I've used it. In general, I have not used Python web
  frameworks for such a long time so some idioms and conventions are a
  little bit different to when I last used them. Considering that our
  plan relies on a minimal backend solely for emitting blobs of data
  (preferably in JSON format), then I do not think that diving deep into
  the template engines aspect is needed...for now!


Week 3
======

  Pending...but with more Angular related stuff!
