==============Week 1================
This week we formed our teams. I posted on the forums early to try get a strong and organised
team for mealMatch. By the first tute we had 4 people and we got our 5th in the tutorial.
We set up Jira and linked it to a github account so that we can make tickets. I've been chosen to be the Scrum master but we're going to try distribute the development work evenly and I will get Waqif who has used Jira before to help me. After the 1st
tutorial  (thursday) we had a quick team meeting to agree upon the likely technology stack we would be using. We've currently agreed upon some Angular frontend single page webapp + flask backend to serve data and stuff with a light SQL database. I set up a google doc for us to collaborate on. Our goal for this week is to read the spec thoroughly and determine the best approaches to implementation as well as start coming up with user stories.


==================Week 2==============
This week we had a meeting on Monday night discussing the proposal and what ideas 
we'd had so far. We drafted user stories together on a google doc and I will be
adding them into Jira throughout the week once we get some more feedback in 
lectures and tutorials. As of monday night we have yet to do the software architecture
and user storyboards.

Throughout the week until the thursday tute we just did some self study of the pieces
of the architecture that we would be using (e.g. Angular and Flask) and made sure to
keep up with the lectures for any further hints with user stories/the proposal.
We also moved our repo from our personal github repo to the github classroom repo.

On thursday we had our tute and got most of the proposal draft done, we added some 
more details to Jira in preparation for sprint planning. We had an unofficial sprint
planning but didnt start it officially on Jira. Manni, Waqif and I worked on the
storyboards for the proposals whilst Emmanuel did architecture and Kenny did US acceptance
criteria. Then we all switched to give feedback on what we had all done.

Throughout the week I got more familiar with admin tasks on Jira, added some of the user
stories, and upgraded to premium temporarily to allow us to delete issues. The proposal
is just about ready for submission (except for formatting) the team is doing an awesome
job!

==================Week 3==============
Throughout the start of this week I've been finalising the user stories on Jira,
placing them into their respective epics and assigning (draft) story point values.
I'm not a huge fan of the Jira UI and it seems to lag on my computer :(. I'm currently
working with the Angular CLI to generate the shell for the frontend. 
On Wednesday I added routes for login and signup and pushed up the shell for the frontend
so that the group could get some ideas on how things work. Currently planning to
give the group a mini demo for thursday to get them started.

On thursday's tutorial we took the opportunity to ask Eugene (Xin) our mentor some questions
about formatting of user stories and how specific we have to be with what we declare in our sprints.
After that we worked on finalising everything in the proposal and moving it to a new
document. We also added our final sprint plan to the document. I read over the whole proposal
to make sure it met the marking criteria. At the end of the tutorial, I also gave the team a small
demo on the angular front end I had set up, and some easy but useful things they can do with it.

Over the weekend I proofread the proposal a few more times, and decided to revamp the background
a little bit to make it more like a marketing pitch. Unfortunately, I injected some spelling errors
that I luckily picked up on Saturday. I also designed a draft UI for the login and signup user stories.
It was my first time using an external library for components so it took a bit of getting used to but
I think the outcome was not bad and the team seemed to like the look.

On Sunday morning I submitted the proposal after a few touchups and approval from everyone. 
I'm glad its in because it's a bit of a weight off my chest! The plan for next week is
to try to hook up the frontend login logic to the back end. I've never done anything like this
before so it should be a great learning experience. So far the team is doing a GREAT job.
Everyone is working hard and all we need to work on is our communication a little bit.


==================Week 4==============
This week I got a lot done. I set up all the authentication routes and components in the webapp and managed to get them
communicating with the backend in a primitive fashion. I made an auth service to handle all the authentication logic,
and an auth guard to handle routes that we only want logged in users to see. Currently we don't have any but it 
might be useful in the future. One problem that I'm facing is understanding observables, we basically need to use
observables rather than just primitive types when trying to make the UI responsive to changes in data from network 
requests and such. This has been a bit of a learning curve but I'm making steady progress. By the end of the week
I managed to set the login state for a user with observables and subjects. I've also been writing tickets and todo's
on Jira for the team to pick up. We're all doing a great job but Emmanuel seems to have gone MIA for a bit, I hope he's ok!
Later in the week I also tried to make the primitive login components I had made previously much more usable and aesthetic.
Looking forward to more!

==================Week 5==============
This week I've been really busy with other subjects but I've managed to make the auth pages all much more responsive with both observables
and promises. For example, now whilst the page is submitting a network request, the login button will be disabled and a spinner will be shown
to the users so that they know that there is something going on in the background. Whilst in terms of functionality this isnt that important,
I think its key to the user experience that they can see what's happening. I've also implemented an HTTPinterceptor and placed a delay on all
network requests because there's almost no delay on localhost so it isnt realistic.
This week we also had the demo so most of the week was spent making sure that all the user stories we had set out to do got completed. This meant I was refining the error handling on my Auth Pages. I had a lot of troubles getting validators to work as I intended because I wasn't sure how to mix some validators that update on "change" and others on "submit". I wrote the demo outline so we would know exactly what we were doing and the team helped attach the corresponding user stories. I presented the demo and the feedback for our work was that it was impressive functionally but the UI looked a bit unprofressional. I can't say I disagree but I am definitely more of a functionality sort of person. We checked with Eugene if it was ok to work on functionality first and then work on the UI later, he said this was ok. We also checked with Eugene if Emmanuel (who has been absent for 2 weeks now) is still in the course, he said he didn't know but he'd follow it up.

Our team had the retro right after our tute. We reflected on the week and found a few issues with communication and doubling up on tasks but overall everyone (Emmanuel still wasnt present) thought we had a great sprint. I'd agree.

Pretty good week all in all.

==================Week 6==============
This week is quiet week so I have a bit more time to work on things, but I also don't want to spend too long.
I've worked with Manni to make the home page more capable of error handling and done a few small
UI related tasks that were found at the end of last sprint. One thing I've been doing a lot of 
but havent really spoken about is Jira Management. I'm constantly creating tasks for people to do
on Jira, and when people have time, they assign themselves. Since everyone in our group is dilligent this seems to be working.
The plan for the rest of this week is to start thinking about how we might make a profile page.

The rest of the week I did little tangible work other than familiarising myself with SQLAlchemy.
With Emmanuel well and truly gone, we only have 4 people and that means that we don't have enough people to fully
separate backend and frontend work. So I've got to know the backend a bit so I can get things done for myself when
I'm blocked by the backend on frontend work. Most of the team took week 6 off a bit since it was flexibility week 
which is fine as long as we pick back up next sprint!

==================Week 7==============
At the start of this week, I finalised the retrospective A document (it was pretty small and simple) and ran it by the group to make sure we hadn't missed
anything. I wrote out a bunch of tickets for everyone to do in case they weren't sure what areas we needed to work on. I also made huge progress on the profile
page, it works but I haven't spent any time on the UI because I feel like we will change the whole UI style later anyway. My biggest struggle this week was
working out the best way to delete a component off the page based on an action in a different component. I ended up using a combination of the MatDialog (and
subscriptions) and EventEmitters to propagate the change to the required components. I also did some work on the backend to create the endpoints that I required,
like the user_info endpoint and some methods on the models that it would require to get the information. We don't have many user stories left but we definitely
have a lot of UI work to do :/
