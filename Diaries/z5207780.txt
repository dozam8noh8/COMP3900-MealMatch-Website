==============Week 1================
This week we formed our teams. I posted on the forums early to try get a strong and organised
team for mealMatch. By the first tute we had 4 people and we got our 5th in the tutorial.
We set up Jira and linked it to a github account so that we can make tickets. I've been chosen to be the Scrum master but we're going to try distribute the development work evenly and I will get Waqif who has used Jira before to help me. After the 1st
tutorial  (thursday) we had a quick team meeting to agree upon the likely technology stack we would be using. We've currently agreed upon some Angular frontend single page webapp + flask backend to serve data and stuff with a light SQL database. I set up a google doc for us to collaborate on. Our goal for this week is to read the spec thoroughly and determine the best approaches to implementation as well as start coming up with user stories.


==================Week 2==============
This week we had a meeting on Monday night discussing the proposal and what ideas 
we'd had so far. We drafted user stories together on a google doc and I will be
adding them into Jira throughout the week once we get some more feedback in 
lectures and tutorials. As of monday night we have yet to do the software architecture
and user storyboards.

Throughout the week until the thursday tute we just did some self study of the pieces
of the architecture that we would be using (e.g. Angular and Flask) and made sure to
keep up with the lectures for any further hints with user stories/the proposal.
We also moved our repo from our personal github repo to the github classroom repo.

On thursday we had our tute and got most of the proposal draft done, we added some 
more details to Jira in preparation for sprint planning. We had an unofficial sprint
planning but didnt start it officially on Jira. Manni, Waqif and I worked on the
storyboards for the proposals whilst Emmanuel did architecture and Kenny did US acceptance
criteria. Then we all switched to give feedback on what we had all done.

Throughout the week I got more familiar with admin tasks on Jira, added some of the user
stories, and upgraded to premium temporarily to allow us to delete issues. The proposal
is just about ready for submission (except for formatting) the team is doing an awesome
job!

==================Week 3==============
Throughout the start of this week I've been finalising the user stories on Jira,
placing them into their respective epics and assigning (draft) story point values.
I'm not a huge fan of the Jira UI and it seems to lag on my computer :(. I'm currently
working with the Angular CLI to generate the shell for the frontend. 
On Wednesday I added routes for login and signup and pushed up the shell for the frontend
so that the group could get some ideas on how things work. Currently planning to
give the group a mini demo for thursday to get them started.

On thursday's tutorial we took the opportunity to ask Eugene (Xin) our mentor some questions
about formatting of user stories and how specific we have to be with what we declare in our sprints.
After that we worked on finalising everything in the proposal and moving it to a new
document. We also added our final sprint plan to the document. I read over the whole proposal
to make sure it met the marking criteria. At the end of the tutorial, I also gave the team a small
demo on the angular front end I had set up, and some easy but useful things they can do with it.

Over the weekend I proofread the proposal a few more times, and decided to revamp the background
a little bit to make it more like a marketing pitch. Unfortunately, I injected some spelling errors
that I luckily picked up on Saturday. I also designed a draft UI for the login and signup user stories.
It was my first time using an external library for components so it took a bit of getting used to but
I think the outcome was not bad and the team seemed to like the look.

On Sunday morning I submitted the proposal after a few touchups and approval from everyone. 
I'm glad its in because it's a bit of a weight off my chest! The plan for next week is
to try to hook up the frontend login logic to the back end. I've never done anything like this
before so it should be a great learning experience. So far the team is doing a GREAT job.
Everyone is working hard and all we need to work on is our communication a little bit.
