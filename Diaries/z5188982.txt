==============Week 1================
We made our groups in the tute made sure we chose our project.
We've also made sure we set up Jira and chose Owen as the scrum master. I've
also decided to help Owen with Jira since I've used it before and it would help
me keep up as well. We've done a fair bit of architecture design as well and
decided it would be best to use an Angular frontend and a Flask RESTful api
backend to serve the data with an SQLlite db.

==============Week 2================
We've had a meeting and went through the specs together. We've also drafted up
some epics and user stories to decide our flow. We'll work on the storyboards
and architecture by the end of this week or early next week. That should help
us get the proposal done early and take time to review it before submitting.

Our storyboards were done thanks to Manni walking us through drawing them and
we kept on helping her with the UX stuff. I also spent a bit of time looking at
Jira with Owen and making sure our stuff was going good. I spent rest of the week
working on the Python backend part. Since we've decided to work with Flask, I've
drafted out everything we need to setup a basic RESTful api and built a skeleton
after going through a bunch of online tutorials. This should be good enough to setup
the whole API as long as we have our modals and endpoints working.

==============Week 3================
Pretty much done setting up the backend. We worked on completing the proposal instead
since that's due this week. We joined in on a session during and after the tute to work
together and get it done. We split up in groups, one to work on the user stories and me,
Owen and Manni worked on the story boards, and the other stuff. We were done early so we
collaborated together to finish the google doc. Once done, we reviewed together and submitted

Spent the remaining of the week working on designing the backend. We designed the ER and schema
to build the models for the backend. We also found out TheMealDb as an api to populate our backend

==============Week 4================
I've started working on the backend. I've scrapped themealdb to find out the categories.
I've pretty much made the schema in the flask, and made a script to populate the db.
I've also setup the endpoints for searching meals, find all the ingredients and categories.
My next task is to work on recommendations and setup endpoints to add recipes.

The recommendations endpoint is setup on the backend but I'm waiting for the frontend tasks to finish.
Once we get that page up, we can connect to the endpoint we can connect and it should be up on the page.

==============Week 5================
We got to the point where we were updating some requirements for our ingredients amounts. So we had to
change a bit of the db schema then push the things up again. TheMealDb is a bit of a pain to work with
Me and Kenny had to spend quite a lot of time parsing the stuff and repopulating it again. We ended up
finishing all of our tasks on Jira and ended up doing more than we expected but if TheMealDb stuff was
working from the first it would've been easier for both of us. Me and Kenny also spent a bit of time to
fix up the shape of some of the endpoints to ensure the demo goes well and we can tick off tickets. My
next task would be return meaningful error messages and setup some endpoints for users to add new recipes.
The feedback from Eugene mentioned about improving our UI which we decided to do after we finish most
of our tickets. I am planning on spending some time on that if I'm free from tasks. Demo went pretty well,
retro was good as well.

==============Week 6===============
During the start of the flexibility week I decided to work on some of the stuff early to take the weekend
off. Since this sprint is 3 weeks, we have a lot more tickets to work on and more importantly I decided to
finish the backend work altogether in this sprint and leave not much for the next sprint so I can take over
some of the frontend tasks, mainly UI updating since our UI isn't very aesthetic now. I finished up all of
the recipe endpoints on the backend (create recipe, add ingredients, add mealtypes, etc) where Kenny helped
me with some of the tasks too. This should essentially make sure most of our 'essential' endpoints for the
demo and user stories are completed, however, we decided to add new features outside our user stories too
so I should be working on those from next week.

=============Week 7===============
This week I made sure the backend was 90% finished. Setting up endpoints, backend and database work was done
to make sure the most commonly searched for ingredient pairs with no recipes are recommended to recipe authors. This was probably one of the most challenging tasks since the entire thing is done on the backend and the
frontend only needs to consume the data returned. There was also an issue with our authentication regarding
security and our JWT tokens and I looked at the bug and fixed it in between tasks. After that, the only 
remaining page I had to work on was the profile page where I setup the backend for viewing profile data,
updating, etc. Owen decided to add a ratings feature for recipes too so I spend the remaining time of the
week with finishing up the ratings system. Everything seems to be working for now and looks like we are
done with most of the backend work. We will need to make new endpoints every now and then because the
frontend might need help but backend work can sort of wrap up here and I can move on to UI work from next
sprint.

==============Week 8==============
As planned I moved on to fixing more of the UI for this week. I had to spend a bit of time to design a logo
for our page and also all the assets and icons for the site. Canva was pretty helpful and making sure assets
were open to use in terms of copyright for us. From then on I ended up redesigning the entire navbar,
login page, register page and recipe results page which took the entire week. The redesign should be good
enough for this milestone. The next UI update will be the recipe page. For next sprint, I plan on
refactoring code on backend for the style marks and finish up the UI update.

==============Week 9==============
This week was a massive week for all of us. I've got most of the UI update and although it was quite a lot of work,
it makes the website look multiple times better at least since it required changing design for pretty much every single page.
The website now looks very professional and looks like a production sort of a website that users would use. The UI bit was a 
good intro to frontend for us backend guys and helped put massive improvement to our UI/UX for the website. For 
the backend, I've pretty much been doing quite a lot of backend work too such as setting up ratings for backend, pagination for search,
setting up all the hall of fame endpoints which was quite a lot of calculation from the backend. This was undoubtedly the most
busiest week in terms of getting work done but this was surely the most impactful. Our application is pretty much ready for submission
and all we need to do that's left is getting our setup docs ready and doing more testing for bugs before submission.
