==============Week 1================
We made our groups in the tute made sure we chose our project.
We've also made sure we set up Jira and chose Owen as the scrum master. I've
also decided to help Owen with Jira since I've used it before and it would help
me keep up as well. We've done a fair bit of architecture design as well and
decided it would be best to use an Angular frontend and a Flask RESTful api
backend to serve the data with an SQLlite db.

==============Week 2================
We've had a meeting and went through the specs together. We've also drafted up
some epics and user stories to decide our flow. We'll work on the storyboards
and architecture by the end of this week or early next week. That should help
us get the proposal done early and take time to review it before submitting.

Our storyboards were done thanks to Manni walking us through drawing them and
we kept on helping her with the UX stuff. I also spent a bit of time looking at
Jira with Owen and making sure our stuff was going good. I spent rest of the week
working on the Python backend part. Since we've decided to work with Flask, I've
drafted out everything we need to setup a basic RESTful api and built a skeleton
after going through a bunch of online tutorials. This should be good enough to setup
the whole API as long as we have our modals and endpoints working.
