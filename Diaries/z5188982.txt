==============Week 1================
We made our groups in the tute made sure we chose our project.
We've also made sure we set up Jira and chose Owen as the scrum master. I've
also decided to help Owen with Jira since I've used it before and it would help
me keep up as well. We've done a fair bit of architecture design as well and
decided it would be best to use an Angular frontend and a Flask RESTful api
backend to serve the data with an SQLlite db.

==============Week 2================
We've had a meeting and went through the specs together. We've also drafted up
some epics and user stories to decide our flow. We'll work on the storyboards
and architecture by the end of this week or early next week. That should help
us get the proposal done early and take time to review it before submitting.

Our storyboards were done thanks to Manni walking us through drawing them and
we kept on helping her with the UX stuff. I also spent a bit of time looking at
Jira with Owen and making sure our stuff was going good. I spent rest of the week
working on the Python backend part. Since we've decided to work with Flask, I've
drafted out everything we need to setup a basic RESTful api and built a skeleton
after going through a bunch of online tutorials. This should be good enough to setup
the whole API as long as we have our modals and endpoints working.

==============Week 3================
Pretty much done setting up the backend. We worked on completing the proposal instead
since that's due this week. We joined in on a session during and after the tute to work
together and get it done. We split up in groups, one to work on the user stories and me,
Owen and Manni worked on the story boards, and the other stuff. We were done early so we
collaborated together to finish the google doc. Once done, we reviewed together and submitted

Spent the remaining of the week working on designing the backend. We designed the ER and schema
to build the models for the backend. We also found out TheMealDb as an api to populate our backend

==============Week 4================
I've started working on the backend. I've scrapped themealdb to find out the categories.
I've pretty much made the schema in the flask, and made a script to populate the db.
I've also setup the endpoints for searching meals, find all the ingredients and categories.
My next task is to work on recommendations and setup endpoints to add recipes.
