==============Week 1================
We made our groups in the tute made sure we chose our project.
We've also made sure we set up Jira and chose Owen as the scrum master. I've
also decided to help Owen with Jira since I've used it before and it would help
me keep up as well. We've done a fair bit of architecture design as well and
decided it would be best to use an Angular frontend and a Flask RESTful api
backend to serve the data with an SQLlite db.

==============Week 2================
We've had a meeting and went through the specs together. We've also drafted up
some epics and user stories to decide our flow. We'll work on the storyboards
and architecture by the end of this week or early next week. That should help
us get the proposal done early and take time to review it before submitting.
