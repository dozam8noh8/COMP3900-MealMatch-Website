Week 1
We formed the group and created the Jira, GitHub, FB messenger and google docs groups. I familiarised myself with the specs and the example mealmatch (supercook.com). Thereafter, I then attended a group meeting and was able to begin contributing by drafting out the epic stories with its corresponding user stories. We also chose a tech stack that we would likely use (Angular, SQLite, Flask).

Week 2
I worked on the user stories which involved splitting, adding and refinding them. In particular, I had wrote the acceptance criterias such that they were quite detailed. This would involve both frontend and backend details. As such, I had to draw upon the storyboards as that had predominantly described the UI/UX experience.

Week 3
After some confusion with the delegation of tasks, I began investing on how to populate our DB of recipe data. I looked through a few APIs and determined their suitability. This had involved considering the requirements as it was important that the API data we scraped from had considered whether was comprehensive enough to consider things like a meal type or an ingredient category. If they did not include this information, then we would have to manually input these types of data. Thereafter, it was determined that Spoonacular satisfied all the criteria and so I began work on scraping this data. I began drafting up a DB schema and scripts so that it could directly call Spoonacular's API and store the corresponding data. I first began on storing the 1000 most popular ingredients as this would provide the most abundant type of recipes. Restricting the number of ingredients also ensured that when searching up an ingredient, the user would not be overwhelmed with too many ingredients.
