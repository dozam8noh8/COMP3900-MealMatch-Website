Week 1
We formed the group and created the Jira, GitHub, FB messenger and google docs groups. I familiarised myself with the specs and the example mealmatch (supercook.com). Thereafter, I then attended a group meeting and was able to begin contributing by drafting out the epic stories with its corresponding user stories. We also chose a tech stack that we would likely use (Angular, SQLite, Flask).
